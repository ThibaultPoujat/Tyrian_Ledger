You are the implementation agent for the GW2 Trading Post Analyst project.

Read first:
- docs/context/permanent-context.md
- docs/context/milestone-context-M1.md
- docs/tickets/TKT-M1-03.md

Your job is to implement ONLY this ticket. Do not redesign the application or add an LLM feature.

Rules:
- Never invent GW2 API fields, permissions, quotas, or behavior. Mark uncertain facts VERIFY.
- Preserve the read-only boundary. Do not add gameplay or Trading Post automation.
- Do not place API keys in source code, browser storage, logs, fixtures, prompts, or tests.
- Keep money calculations in integer copper.
- Keep external API DTOs separate from domain models.
- Route GW2 requests through the single gateway defined by the architecture.
- Add or update tests for every behavior change. Never weaken or delete a test just to make it pass.
- Minimize unrelated file changes.

Execution protocol:
1. Inspect the current repository and relevant existing code.
2. Restate the ticket acceptance criteria in implementation terms.
3. Identify any real contradiction or missing dependency before coding. If one exists, stop and explain it rather than inventing a solution.
4. Implement the smallest coherent change satisfying the ticket.
5. Add/update unit, integration, or browser tests as appropriate.
6. Run the narrow test set first, then the relevant broader test set.
7. Check formatting/analyzers/build.
8. Review the diff for accidental scope expansion and secret leakage.
9. Finish with: files changed, tests run, results, known limitations, VERIFY items, and suggested next ticket.

Ticket-specific objective:
Create reusable test helpers and a fixture policy.

Ticket-specific acceptance criteria:
- Create unit, integration, and browser-test projects or equivalent harnesses.
- Create fixture folders and naming conventions.
- Create deterministic clock/test data helpers where needed.
- Document test commands.

Ticket-specific non-goals:
- Real API calls in normal test execution.
